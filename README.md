# Leulged - Competitive Programming Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various **LeetCode** and **Codeforces** problems. The solutions cover a wide range of topics, including arrays, strings, linked lists, trees, graphs, dynamic programming, and more.

## Structure

Each folder in this repository corresponds to a problem, named with its **problem number and title**. Inside each folder, you'll find the solution code along with any related notes or README files for specific problems.

### Example Folder Names
- `1-two-sum`
- `100-same-tree`
- `1013-fibonacci-number`
- `150-evaluate-reverse-polish-notation`

### Notes
- Execution time and memory usage are indicated for each solution (LeetSync stats).  
- Some folders include additional README files with explanations for specific problems.

## Problem Categories
- **Array & Strings**: Two Sum, Maximum Width Ramp, Split a String, etc.  
- **Linked Lists**: Remove Nth Node, Merge Two Sorted Lists, Linked List Cycle, etc.  
- **Binary Trees**: Symmetric Tree, Binary Tree Traversals, Maximum Difference Between Node and Ancestor, etc.  
- **Dynamic Programming**: Fibonacci Number, Minimum Moves, Maximum Candies, etc.  
- **Graphs**: Course Schedule, Find if Path Exists in Graph, All Ancestors of a Node, etc.  
- **Other Topics**: LRU Cache, Browser History, Special Discounts, String Shifting, etc.

## Stats
- Solutions are optimized for runtime and memory efficiency.  
- Language: Primarily Python (but may include other languages depending on the problem).

## How to Use
